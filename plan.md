# TPMS Implementation Plan

- [x] Initialize Next.js app with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and ESLint.
- [x] Install core dependencies (lucide-react, clsx, tailwind-merge, framer-motion, zod, react-hook-form, @supabase/ssr, @supabase/supabase-js).
- [x] Structure `src` with feature route groups (`(auth)`, `(dashboard)`) and API handlers.
- [x] Scaffold shared components (`components/ui`, `components/layout`, `components/forms`, `components/shared`, `components/cult-ui`).
- [ ] Add Supabase helpers (`client`, `server`, `middleware`) plus utilities/constants.
- [ ] Add services (`trademarks`, `invoices`) and custom hooks.
- [x] Provide starter pages for auth and dashboard flows (mock data).
- [ ] Run lint and formatting checks.
